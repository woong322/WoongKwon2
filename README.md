# Information Show and Set Code

THis code was a assignment I programmed in the Java class, CS232.       
It makes user to see what the .cvs file' information for.      
By using a ahow to pull out nrraylist and hashmap in Java,
it makes me to understand how to pull out the information from a file and use a arraylist and hashmap .      

## Getting Started

-Java Development Kit(JKD) 8th

  4. Run the Netbeans.
  5. Download Cs232lab3b.java file to in to your computer.
  6. Open the Cs232lab3b.java file from the computer.
  7. Run the file in the Netbeans.

## Description
The class had recently been discussing Java collection,    
such as ArrayList and HashMap.
So that maps are collections of values, but unlike lists,     
the elements within the collection are stored as key/value pairs.   
This means that, instead of referring to an element according to its numeric index (its location within the collection),     
as the class did with lists, THe class refer to the elements of a map by their keys
(the names that what program assigned to them when we added them to the collection).
This assignment is intended to give class some additional practice in working with maps and lists in
Java, as well as file input and output. Before proceeding with this lab,      
The attached input file is a "database" of names and addresses in comma separated values (CSV) format.
Files in this format are often used to store tables of information in text form.      
In this particular file, the "rows" (also known as records) correspond to information about a single person,
and the "columns" (also known as fields) within each row correspond to individual attributes of the person
(first name, last name, etc.).      
The fields are joined with commas, which act as delimiters for the fields.
The first row of the file, called the header row, contains descriptive labels for the fields.

## Contributing
It helps the student who is learning java to understand what is arraylist and hashmap.
Also, student can learn how to pull information out form cvs file and how to set the information in the order.

Finally, Pull some requests are very welcome. For some huge changes,    
please open an issue first to discuss what you would like to change that make me know something better.    
Please make sure to update tests as appropriate.
